## Introduction

Founded in 2002, Quantium has a strong track record of driving data science innovation across various industries. As a rapidly growing global leader in data science and AI, the company is dedicated to building a diverse, ambitious, and dynamic team.

In recent years, Quantium has collaborated with a major grocery brand, sharing transactional and consumer data. As part of the Quantium analytics team, our role is to deliver valuable data analytics and insights to support strategic business decisions.

## Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

Analyze the client's transaction dataset to identify customer purchasing behaviors, derive insights, and provide strategic commercial recommendations.

* Transaction Data Assessment: Review the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and incorrect category assignments. Address anomalies, clean the data, and save updated versions to ensure accuracy in analysis.

* Customer Data Evaluation: Check for similar issues in the customer data, handle missing values, and merge it with transaction data for a comprehensive analysis while maintaining proper file-saving practices.

* Data Analysis & Segmentation: Define key metrics such as total sales, sales drivers, and high-performing areas. Visualize trends using charts and graphs, identifying insights that will contribute to the final report for Julia.

* Customer Segmentation & Recommendations: Conduct a deeper analysis to identify target customer segments, assess packet size relevance, and provide data-driven recommendations based on findings.
